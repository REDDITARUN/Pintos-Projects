# Pintos-Projects

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of two significant projects for the Pintos operating system: **Project 1 - Threads** and **Project 2 - User Programs**. Both projects aim to deepen our understanding of operating systems' concepts such as threading, synchronization, scheduling, and system calls.

## Importance of the Projects

### Real-World Application

These projects simulate essential components of an operating system, providing hands-on experience with thread management, process scheduling, and system call handling. This experience is crucial for understanding how modern operating systems work and prepares us for tackling similar challenges in real-world systems.

### Concepts Learned

1. **Thread Management**: Understanding how threads are created, managed, and synchronized.
2. **Scheduling**: Implementing various scheduling algorithms to ensure fair and efficient CPU utilization.
3. **Synchronization**: Using locks, semaphores, and condition variables to manage access to shared resources.
4. **System Calls**: Handling user program interactions with the kernel through system calls.

### Usage and Outcomes

-   **Project 1**: Enhanced the thread scheduler to support priority scheduling and implemented an alarm clock that puts threads to sleep and wakes them up after a specified time.
-   **Project 2**: Implemented argument passing to user programs, handled system calls, and ensured safe memory access from user programs.

## Project 1 - Threads

### Alarm Clock

#### Highlights

-   **Data Structures**:

    -   `int64_t wakeup_after`: Stores the ticks the thread should sleep.
    -   `struct list_elem sleepelem`: List element for sleeping threads.
    -   `void set_thread_sleeping_time(int64_t ticks)`: Sets the thread's sleeping time.

-   **Algorithms**:

    -   `timer_sleep()`: Puts the current thread to sleep without busy waiting, allowing other threads to run. Uses interrupt disabling to ensure atomic operations and prevent race conditions.

-   **Synchronization**:
    -   Race conditions are avoided by disabling interrupts before modifying shared data and using `thread_block()` and `thread_unblock()` to manage thread states atomically.

### Priority Scheduling

#### Highlights

-   **Data Structures**:

    -   `struct lock` with `struct list_elem elem` and `int max_priority`: Used to manage locks and their priority levels.
    -   `int priority_r`, `struct list locks_held`, `struct lock *current_lock`: Used in thread management for handling original priorities and locks held by the thread.

-   **Algorithms**:
    -   Priority donation ensures the highest priority thread gets the CPU by recursively updating priorities through `lock_acquire()` and `lock_release()`.
    -   Ordered lists for waiters in semaphores, locks, and condition variables ensure that the highest priority thread wakes up first.

### Advanced Scheduler

#### Highlights

-   **Data Structures**:

    -   `int nice`, `fixed_point_t r_cpu`, `static fixed_point_t mlfqs_average_load`: Used to calculate thread priorities and manage scheduling in the Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduler (MLFQS).

-   **Algorithms**:
    -   Scheduling decisions are based on `nice` values and `recent_cpu` usage, ensuring fair CPU allocation.
    -   Priority and `recent_cpu` values are updated regularly to reflect the system's load and thread activity.

## Project 2 - User Programs

### Argument Passing

#### Highlights

-   **Data Structures**:

    -   `args_pushing_func`: Prepares the stack with arguments for process execution.
    -   `syscall_handler`: Handles system calls by parsing the system call number and executing corresponding functionality.
    -   `my_user`: Reads user memory into kernel space while ensuring memory access validity.
    -   `userspace_memo`: Performs memory read from user space to kernel space, ensuring validity of memory access.

-   **Algorithms**:
    -   Argument parsing implemented using `strtok_r` to tokenize input strings. Arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order to avoid overflow and ensure correct alignment.

### System Calls

#### Highlights

-   **Data Structures**:

    -   `process_execute`: Tokenizes the command line input and calls `start_process` with the correct arguments.
    -   `start_process`: Loads and creates a user process, pushing arguments onto the stack using `args_pushing_func`.
    -   `syscall_handler`: Handles system calls, including `SYS_EXIT` and `SYS_WRITE`.

-   **Algorithms**:
    -   `sys_write`: Writes data to a file descriptor, handling standard output. Uses `my_user` to check buffer accessibility.
    -   Error handling strategies ensure safe memory access and resource cleanup in case of failures.

### Synchronization

#### Highlights

-   **Synchronization Mechanisms**:
    -   Ensures that system calls are atomic and thread-safe.
    -   Uses semaphores and condition variables to manage process synchronization and prevent race conditions.

### Rationale

-   **Design Choices**:
    -   Implemented argument passing and system calls to ensure robust and efficient user program execution.
    -   Chose thread-safe functions and atomic operations to maintain system integrity and performance.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run the provided tests for each project:

1. **Project 1**:

    ```sh
    cd pintos/src/threads
    make check
    ```

2. **Project 2**:
    ```sh
    cd pintos/src/userprog
    make check
    ```

### Debugging

-   Use `hex_dump()` to dump the stack contents for debugging argument passing issues.
-   Use GDB for more complex debugging needs.

## Conclusion

These projects provide a comprehensive understanding of operating system concepts through practical implementation. The hands-on experience gained is invaluable for grasping the complexities of modern OS design and preparing for real-world challenges in systems programming.
